# Joining Ludex challenges on Solana

Try the demo: https://solana.ludex.gg/

This project is a react.js boilerplate for players (or testers) to join Ludex challenges on Solana using the Ludex Javscript SDK. The Ludex Javascript SDK allows web apps to interact with Ludex APIs and smart contracts. It also has integration with [Web3auth](https://web3auth.io/) for passwordless authentication and non-custodial key infrastructure for wallets.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

then add environment variables in .env (get them from netlify or another dev)

```bash
REACT_APP_SOLANA_RPC=
REACT_APP_SOLANA_RPC_MAINNET=
```

and run the development server and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser!

```bash
npm start
```
