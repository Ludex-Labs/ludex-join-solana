Ludex provides video game developers an easy way to implement smart contracts into games with no blockchain knowledge required.

# Getting Started with Ludex Join

This project is a react.js boilerplate for players (or testers) to join Ludex challenges using the Ludex Javscript SDK [https://github.com/Ludex-Labs/ludex-sdk-js].
The Javascript SDK allows the web app to interact with our API and smart contracts.

This boilerplate has examples of joining challenges on mutliple chains including: Solana, Near, Polygon & Sui.
It also has integration with Web3auth [https://web3auth.io/] for passwordless authentication and non-custodial key infrastructure for wallets.
