# Getting Started with Ludex Join on Solana

Try the demo: https://solana.ludex.gg/

This project is a react.js boilerplate for players (or testers) to join Ludex challenges on Solana using the Ludex Javscript SDK. The Ludex Javascript SDK allows web apps to interact with Ludex APIs and smart contracts. It also has integration with Web3auth [https://web3auth.io/] for passwordless authentication and non-custodial key infrastructure for wallets.
